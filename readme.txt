Question for the day:
You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in Expanded Form. For example:

expandedForm(12); // Should return '10 + 2'
expandedForm(42); // Should return '40 + 2'
expandedForm(70304); // Should return '70000 + 300 + 4'
NOTE: All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.

Number 103 is same as
100 + 3 or
(1x10^2) + (0x10^1) + (3x10^0)
